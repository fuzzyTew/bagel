The habits should be used to discern what is relevent; to form relevence.
The goal should be to choose a relevent habit and do that habit.

These are the basic habits I thought up that a computer program has:
        variables:
                - create a place to store a value
                - place a value in such a place
                - retrieve a value from such a place
        data-structures:
                - make a class definition (collection of variables)
                - initialize an object
                - set/retrieve properties (variables)
        flow:
                - trigger a different step than the next, conditionally
        procedures:
                - collect a set of behaviors together
                - trigger a collected set of behaviors and continue
        expressions:
                - evaluate arithmetic on variables and constants


That is:
========================================================================================================
	- the active goal is to choose what to do and to what, and do it
	- the way to do this is the same as it:
		by picking habits that are relevent in the moment [choose what to do],
		and running them on relevent data [choose to what, and do it]
========================================================================================================
	- the habits should be to identify what is relevent

	- we have a request for the initial goal of the process to be to write a chunk of code out in its own language
		tighter self-reference is made without the extra sourcecode-file step, but it may be slower to code due to not getting as much help from it

The hope is the process becomes good at active choice.
